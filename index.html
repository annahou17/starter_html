                <p>Machu Picchu's remote location and mysterious abandonment in the decades following its construction have contributed to its status as a UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of the New Seven Wonders of the World. The site is characterized by its well-preserved stone structures, including temples, plazas, residential buildings, and intricate terraces carved into the mountainside. The precise construction methods used to build Machu Picchu without the use of mortar have puzzled archaeologists for decades. The entire complex is surrounded by stunning panoramic views of the surrounding valleys and mountains.</p>
